OEE Artificial Life Platform

This is a platform for artificial life that is intended to be open-ended and extendable.   
- plugin classes for program-based or neuralnet-based cells, or create your own
- world classes can be defined for toroidal or a gravity based world, or create your own

Directions:
- Build the app.
- Press the 'new' button to generate a new world. It will generate cells with random dna and a large amount of energy. It may take a minute or two for the first tick of the clock.
- Change the environment parameters using the 'settings' button.
- Observe.

ToDo:
The neural network based cells show more promise and I would like to expand on other type of artificial intelligence and deep learning techniques.
