Artificial Life Platform

This is a platform for artificial life that is intended to be very open-ended and extendable.   
- plugin classes for program-based or neuralnet-based cells, or create your own
- world classes can be defined for toroidal or a gravity based world, or create your own

The neural network based cells show more promise and I would like to expand on other type of artificial intelligence and deep learning techniques.
